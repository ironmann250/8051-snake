# usage
- it was written for the STC8952RC MCU but should be compatible with any 8051/2 MCUs
pay attention because it's not very optimized and i solved the memory issue, 
by shifting large variables (2 video buffers among others, this is needed because i didn't have shift registers) in other areas of the memory

- i compiled/edited in keil Âµvision but any ide that supports C51 is fine

- a compiled hex file of the game is provided as well
